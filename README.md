# Barcode Sorter App

Have you ever been in a situation where you have trash, but you don't know how you should throw it away? This app allows users to scan barcodes of certain items that they want to throw away and the app will return detailed instructions of how to properly dispose of it!

# Demo

# User Instructions
1. Open up the Barcode Sorter App
2. Tap on the Camera Icon
3. Scan the barcode of the item you wish to throw away
4. An instruction will pop-up if this barcode is in our [ZotBins](https://zotbins.github.io) database. If it's not, no worries! We will log your barcode and work on getting instructions for it! This will help us populate our database.
